        <h1>Marta Astatike</h1>
        <h2>Web Developer</h2>

        <p>I am a student at Wake Tech community college studying to become web developer.
           I decided to become web developer after comparing my options and my background experience.
          I have 3 years of experience in the IT field- working as IT production support. 
          My job was very interesting from database management to troubleshooting and working with the client on design and validation of projects. 
          Ensure the smooth production of digital and security products including proprietary software updates, integration of different software, 
          testing, supply error log data for analysis, and user acceptance testing.</p>
